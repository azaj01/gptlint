# Quick Start

Getting started with `gptlint` is easy and should only take a few minutes to set up with a new codebase.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

- `node >= 18`

### Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D gptlint
```

We recommended installing `gptlint` as a dev dependency just like `eslint`.

### OpenAI

GPTLint defaults to using the OpenAI API, so you'll need to sign up for an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node). Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable or store it in a `.env` file in your project's root.

<Callout>
  **GPTLint supports local LLMs and other providers**, so if you don't want to
  use OpenAI, [see this guide](./llm-providers).
</Callout>

### Dry Run

```sh
npx gptlint --help
```

By default, `gptlint` uses `**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,cjs,mjs}` to match source files. `.gitignore` will be respected, and optionally `.gptlintignore` as well if it exists.

Now let's try running `gptlint` with the `--dry-run` flag:

```sh
npx gptlint --dry-run
```

<Callout type='warning'>
    The `--dry-run` flag is very useful for estimating how much it would cost to run the linter for real.

    Since [LLM costs can add up quickly](/project/cost) for large codebases,
    it's always a good idea to make sure you understand the projected costs before
    running `gptlint` on a new project.

</Callout>

If you want to try out `gptlint` without worrying about the cost, you can run `gptlint` on a single source file like this:

```sh
npx gptlint --dry-run src/utils.ts
```

If you're ever not sure about what will be run, you can use the `--print-config` flag to view all of the resolved rules, settings, and source files that will be processed:

```sh
npx gptlint --print-config
```

If there are source files being picked up by `gptlint` that you'd like to ignore, you can add glob patterns to a `.gptlintignore` file at the root of your project to ignore them.

### Real Run

Oooooohhhh now comes the fun part! Let's run `gptlint` for real and see what it finds...

```sh
npx gptlint
```

Depending on the size of your codebase, this could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. It'll display a summary of the linter tasks as it runs.

Once it completes, you should see something resembling this output:

<p align='center' style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
  <Image
    src='/example-output-0.png'
    alt='Example output'
    width={1133}
    height={845}
  />
</p>

This example output comes from running `gptlint` fresh on it's own codebase with
caching disabled. It cost a total of _$0.83 USD_ and made _351 LLM calls_
to OpenAI, with the vast majority of them using `gpt-4o-mini`.

More than likely, you'll see some lint errors that you should consider addressing. Just keep in mind that since `gptlint` isn't 100% accurate (like a human code reviewer), it's possible for `gptlint` to report _false positives_ and miss _false negatives_, but we're working hard to improve the accuracy of the core linting engine and built-in rules over time.

For more details on how to interpret the output, see [usage](./usage) and our [faq](/project/faq). Check out the [built-in rules](/rules) to see what `gptlint` can enforce out of the box.

</Steps>
